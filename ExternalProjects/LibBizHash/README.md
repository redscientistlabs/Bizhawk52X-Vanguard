CRC32 code is taken from [zlib-ng](https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng) with massive slashing of code and various tweaks. This code is licensed under the zlib license.
SHA1 is code is taken from [SHA-Intrinsics](https://github.com/noloader/SHA-Intrinsics) with some tweaks. This code is under the public domain.

To build, just do `make` in this directory. Note gcc 10 or later is required (due to missing intrinsics in older gcc versions)
